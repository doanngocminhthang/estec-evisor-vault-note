you know I I I thought thought a lot about the growth of Leo um as a platform and you know I think there's kind of two different stages to our growth um I think right now we're right now we're in this kind of early stage still uh where our growth is is focused on creating you know a thousand true fans and I have an obsession with you know the Kevin Kelly article that was written about that um so I think we've kind of got this like in the early stage of a platform of any kind of a startup of a business um you know and especially of a social network you're going to have the first like thousand hardcore users um and that is like your solid base so you want to create that you know the 1,000 super fans that use uh the platform and you want to cultivate them and you want to make sure that they're all taken care of and happy with the state of the platform um and and I like to say that Master is like the ultimate example of this you know he is like a super fan of Leo he's willing to use it every day he does use it every day he puts in actual effort to provide value to it um you know knowing that it does bring value back to him to do so but also just for the general desire of doing that um so that is you know that's a really important aspect of the initial stage of building a platform and then I think that's like phase one and I don't think we're near there I would I would say that we're probably around like 200 true fans right now where like there's 200 like diard in Leo users that use the platform every single day create a lot of threads provide a lot of value to the platform um and go out of their way for that um and and yeah I sawad manga said 1,000 super fans equals 1,000 premium users I do think there is a correlation between premium users and super fans because a Super Fan is someone that is like if you think about like a Taylor Swift Super Fan they they own every Taylor Swift album they try to go to Every Taylor Swift concert you know the movie The Taylor Swift movie comes out and they instantly watch it um so if you think about that but for the in Leo version it's like an in Leo Super Fan is someone who is always a premium user they're creating a lot of blog posts because they know it benefits the platform they're making a lot of threads because they enjoy it and they know it benefits the platform they even go out of their way to to do initiatives that benefit the platform like you know Taskmaster and Leo glossery um so that is like the definition of a Super Fan so I don't think it's just like oh you have to pay money to be a super fan but I do think that if you are a super fan then you understand the value proposition of premium and you're naturally going to flow into it anyways so I actually do think premium is a good lens into what a Super Fan it's a good metric to kind of um give you some idea of the amount of super fans on Leo um there's other ways to measure it too I was thinking of metrics for that you know how many threads like how many people create more than 100 threads a month um and things like that you know there's there's plenty of metrics you could use to define a super fan and like I said I think there you know phase one is get to a th000 uh super fans on in Leo um so you know I think we're we're at about 200 in my opinion uh even though we have about 1,600 monthly active users I would say about 200 of them are super fans um and the goal is to scale that to a thousand and I think the plat form looks a lot different with a thousand super fans like the activity on threads the number of blog posts the number of comments number of curators all of those metrics just start to blow up with um you know having a th000 super fans and then obviously too I think we'll be at around a th premium subscribers as well um so that's phase one of the growth of a social network in my opinion phase two of the growth is when you start to uh take hold of network effects um so that's where you know a thousand you know super fans are are basically creating an environment where you can now go out and get that that Network effect started um so you know you get an influencer that brings in 10,000 people suddenly the platform goes from 10,000 monthly active users and a th000 super fans to 20,000 monthly active users and you know 1,200 super fans for example and so I think phase two is going to be like this rapid um exponential like just just straight up Arrow uh growth for the plat platform and that that's if you look at any history of any social network that's kind of how it goes it's like you've got this base of really hardcore users and then suddenly there's a moment where it just like Network effects take hold and everything explodes um so I don't even remember the original question but that is my opinion is that there's two main phases to the growth of a platform like Leo and right now we're in the Super Fan stage so you know we're chasing after 10,000 monthly active users but even more important than that metric is the 1,000 hardcore users of the platform and I I like to think that we're at about 200 right now so we've got a ways to go to get out of phase one but but um you know it really takes building building that initial base to get to where you want to go
