I want you to go through
kind of your perspective of, cause you mentioned the
thousand true fans concept and that's a pretty, you
know, it's a pretty famous, uh, article that was written
what like 10, 12 years ago, 2006 or something like that. Yeah. I want to hear your
perspective of you don't have to bring everyone. You don't have to even have. Funnels really? Cause I like there's a line. You said somewhere. I don't know if it was
in the book or a podcast, his funnels aren't they
don't create fans for you. Funnels aren't
creating fans for you. It's it's this process that
you take people through. So, um, yeah. I'd love your perspective
on the whole thousand true fans concept. It funnels are
important by the way. I mean it creates systems to
then allow yourself more time to do these, these things that
can help you gain more fans. Um, But they're not created
overnight and they are created by the moments that you
create for them over time. From the moment they find
you to the moment that they're, you know, paying
VIP dollars to go to your event and spend time with you
and take photos backstage. And, you know, they,
they feel great about it. Like they just take
you up on that offer. Uh, but, but when it, when it
comes to fans, particularly the, the most important thing
is like, you know, a lot of us are building to get more
eyeballs and that's great. But if you try to serve
everybody, you're actually going to serve nobody. Right? It's like the difference
between, you know, if you're going to open a shoe store
and it's like a general shoe store, I want basketball
shoes and casual shoes and the high heels for the
women and the kids' shoes and the ones who are going
to be running a marathon. It's going to be so difficult
to have a unique selling proposition, unless you make
everything cheap as heck. Right. And that's who is selling
the general shoes, there's Walmart and Target and
Shoe Pavilion and whatever. Right. I would much rather go, okay,
well, who am I serving first? And what are their needs? All right. I'm going to serve
marathon runners, right? Like that's my niche. Okay. That wipes out
millions of people. There are millions of
everybody, mostly wear shoes. Now I'm only focusing on
such a small percentage of people who need
shoes, but you know what? I'm going to be more
successful because the riches are in the niches. And I know it's
pronounced niches. Don't quote me on that,
but it rhymes better. Um, so now I have my
shoe store where branding wise, I can tie into the
psychology of the runner. Um, I can create something,
an environment where a person can come in and feel like
they're going to be running their first race or, or
they're winning the race. The shoes in particular,
the distribution line is so different. Now because I'm only focusing
on shoes and it all ties into who am I serving? I can have them come in
and I can go, Hey, where are you running next? And, Oh, I'm running
my first marathon. Cool. Here's some shoes
that'll help you. If you have wider feet here's
shoes, that'll help you. You know, whatever. Like all things become
easier when you niche down. And the cool thing is with
a thousand true fans, like the numbers, when you run
the numbers, it's like, well, that's so obvious. I don't need a million fans. I don't need to
make the next one. Uber or, or, or Tesla or
fidget spinner or whatever. I just need a thousand
true fans, those true fans. So let's do some math
here, like a, a thousand people paying let's go,
let's go, let's go G like generous here, uh, or, or,
or light, um, a hundred dollars a year for something. Right. I spend. A hundred dollars a
week on Pokemon cards. I'm a fan of Pokemon cards
and a hundred dollars a year. That's like if you're a fan
of something you're likely going to spend more than
that, but let's just say a hundred dollars a year,
a hundred dollars a year times a thousand people
is a six figure business. Right? And likely if you're
focusing so deep in that little niche, you could
probably get thousands of dollars from an individual. We want to go deeper with you. And so it's this idea of,
you know, you, you want to go one mile wide, one inch deep. Where you can only serve
each sort of sector of that landscape, you know,
just a little bit, or do you want to take a little
chunk an inch wide and go a mile deep with them? And now you're serving them
with some software products at the top and let's go vertical. Now you're serving them
some coaching programs. Now they're traveling to go
to your mastermind group. The same person now can
interact with you in many different ways. And you have this like ladder
now that they're climbing to go higher and higher into
your brand and also to become more and more of a fan. Um, the question that I
asked myself and my team asks ourselves every
day, is this like, have we earned a fan today? Because when you think
about the thousand true fans, that's a fan of day
for less than three years. Some people struggle
with business for years before they make it. But if you just had one
new fan of day, less than three years, six figures, Yeah. I mean, and that's,
that's amazing. And I'm thinking of the
whole, uh, you know, fans plus funnels. It's exactly what you said. It's like, okay, you track
this fan and then the funnel can help, you know, bump
that a hundred dollars to the thousand dollars. Yeah. So it's that blend
of the two of them. Super powerful. Talk about the, um, I
know you have this whole period in the book. This is how it's
all structured. And I liked the book. How it's. Extremely tactical and
that's, you know, it's like story and tactics,
uh, but you have a flow. I think it's what four
steps, the, the pyramid of, um, a fandom. So maybe lightly cover
that and show us the process of what it takes
to become a super fan or attract super fans that is. If you imagine like  a
pyramid, right, or a triangle and you divide the
triangle into four different sectors, the largest sectors
on the bottom, right. The baseline. Um, and this is
essentially this triangle represents anybody who's
ever found you, right? Anybody who's ever found you,
um, an engagement pyramid or the pyramid of fandom, the
largest chunk of the bottom is you, is what I like to
call your casual audience. These are people
who just found you. Maybe they found you through
a Google link or a link on another website or a mention
somewhere, or just kind of randomly on social media. They don't necessarily know
who you are yet, but they've come to you for something
that you've done or offered or because somebody else shared
that link or something, and this is the largest space. And as new people come in,
this is where they come in. They don't, they
they're, they're not. Subscribed yet. They're not followers. Our job is to convert
them from there to the next tier, a little bit
smaller, but more powerful. And that's the active
audience sector. And this is where people
are now subscribed. They're following you. This is the point at which
they know who you are. And when you come out
with something, maybe even a product to sell,
they're like, okay, cool. Like I like this
person I'm active in their subscribership. And you know, I'll see if
this works for me or not. And they'll at least sort
of entertain the position of, of the offer more than
just somebody who finds you randomly for the first time. Um, and then moving up from
there, we need to convert our active audience members
to feel like they're a part of a connected community. And the connected, connected
community is really where the magic starts to happen
and where your brand starts to differentiate itself
from other brands doing a lot of the same things. And when you think about
community, you think of people not just coming because of
you or you talking to them or them talking to you, it's
them talking to each other. There's like that
commonality of the brand to have as a baseline for
people to find each other and talk to each other. And have some common
ground to start off with versus just random people. And that is so, so powerful. If you imagine going to a
baseball game and your team is down by three runs and
there's two outs, you're your guys up to bat with
two outs and Boomi hits the grand slam to win your
high five and, and hugging people that you've never met
before, because you're in the stands with the home crowd. And they're all wearing
the same symbol that you have on your hat, right? It's like, that's the
kind of feel that a community can have. And of course, fandom is on
top of that in a little tiny pyramid, but that's like the
thousand true fans up there. We're just wacko for you. Right. And it's cool. Um, and I say that in, in kind
of a humanist way, but it's so important to understand
just how powerful a small group of fans can actually be. I mean, these guys,
these guys are gonna wave your flag so high. They're going to promote your
stuff without ever asking. If you have a troll show
up in your audience. Like you won't even know
because they're already fending them off for you. Right? Like that's how
important a fan can be. And this progression of
casual to active to community, to, um, super fans is,
is, is really the way that the book is structured. And each chapter is sort
of like, okay, here's how you do ha here's how you
convert somebody from a casual audience member
to active and, and that's really where it starts. And it's funny cause we're
talking about a pyramid and what happens when you flip
that pyramid upside down? You got your first
funnel, right? We've got our funnel, but
the problem with the funnel is when you build it and
you should build it, it's like, Oh, all we have to
do is pour from the top and everything happens. And it's like, you
lose the human factor. Um, whereas if you flip it
over and you think really about where's most of the
engagement where most of your repeat customers coming
from, where is most of the money being spent it's at
the top of the pyramid, but it's not a funnel anymore. You have to climb the pyramid. There's there's gravity sort
of working against you here. And so it does take
work and this book will show you how to like. Have anti-gravity if you want. Yeah.
